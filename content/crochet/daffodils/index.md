It was 9am in the morning and I've been itching to use [Qing's fibre kid's mohair silk in Daffodils](https://www.qingfibre.com/products/kid-mohair-silk-daffodils-1). I was also really excited to wear this when I'm back in Singapore, so I impulsively made a mini crop top. The pattern was really simple - a whole bunch of double crochets for the top part, with dc2tog for each row after the 5th to make the cup-like shape. The bottom is held together with a few rows of triple crochets :)
