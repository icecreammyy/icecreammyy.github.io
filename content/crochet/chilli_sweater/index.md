Inspiration for this sweater came really quickly! I bought pom-pom yarn from this [etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1556460966/golden-autumn-100gr-kid-mohairbaby-funny?ref=yr_purchases) and immediately I knew what to do.

I also had some chilli-coloured mohair-ish yarn that complemented and contrasted the muted soft colours really well to go with it and I'm so glad it turned out well :-) I paired the chilli-coloured yarn with another strand of curry coloured mohair, and it reminded me of fresh sambal chilli back home in Singapore :D
This sweater only took around 2 days to finish - it was mostly held together by double and triple crochets, and it also helped that the yarn was pretty chunky and thick. 

In total, I used around 2.5 skeins of the linked yarn, and 0.5 skeins of the chilli mohair yarn for my stripes.
