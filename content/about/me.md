Hi! I don't know how you stumbled upon my little journal but welcome to this little messy mind of mine.
I'd like to think of myself as a {{< highlight background_colour="#fc7465" colour="white" text=" curious wanderer" >}} who enjoys getting lost in rabbit holes.

## Passions and Interests
For as long as I can remember, music has always been something I'm extremely passionate about. Don't get me wrong, it's not like I *have* to listen to music all the time, and I do have my slumps and downtimes when I feel extremely uninspired and bored by it. However, I enjoy talking about it - musical structures, how different sounds makes me feel etc. It is one of the many rabbit holes I'm constantly in, and I share my explorations and findings on my [radio show](https://www.radiofreebrooklyn.org/show/so-far-away/). ðŸ˜€

But as I grow older, my relationship with how I consume content changes too. I find myself wanting to create more - because consuming can only bring you *thaaat* much joy. This year, I found myself getting crafty with my hands and got sucked into the world of crocheting and fibre arts. The feeling of creating my first piece of clothing was undescribable - a whole world of possibilities opened up for me on what I can do, and in a way, creating your own art gives you a chance to have your own voice. A channel of expression. What you create screams "This is me!", and I've been obsessed ever since. By creating my own clothes, I also realised how much humans overconsume, and how messed up our consumption patterns have become. Which brings me to my next point.....

Humans overconsume in almost every aspect of our lives. I've always been a volume eater - if I didn't care that much about my health, I'd eat so much more and I'd grow so fat but I can't do that to my body especially having some *physical deficiencies*. We've become so greedy in how we consume. (Or at least I did)

I find myself overcoming greed when I ask myself this question:

{{< highlight background_colour="white" colour="#fc7465" text="How much do I really need?" >}} 

The answer is often: Not much, actually.

But not everyone feels the same way - heck, I don't even feel that way 80% of the time. And this worries me when global warming is ~supposedly~ looming around. I often find myself thinking about how to grow food and consume sustainably, how to de-industrialise systems that cause so much damage to the environment. How do we design systems that doesn't incentivise over-consumption? It's difficult when corporations are profit driven - which makes me wonder, when are these antiquated economic systems going to get a facelift???

These are some themes that I've been curious about for the past few years - if anyone wants to talk about it or share their views on it, please hit me up :D

Lastly, we can't forget some **fun facts** on my about me page!
